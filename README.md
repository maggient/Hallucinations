# Project: Hallucinations
Welcome to Maggie Nguyen’s CRCP3360 project, inspired by design thinking and rooted in the aesthetics and design principles of Japan.

## Trigger Warning
This project contains flashing lights and rapidly changing colors. Viewer discretion is advised. 

## About this project
Made with TouchDesigner, this project offers a visual representation of a hallucination from a first-person perspective. As cannabis is strictly illegal in Japan today, it has historically held significance in religious and ritual contexts. This work helps users imagine how the visual experience of being under the influence of cannabis might appear within sacred Japanese settings. 

## Japanese Yūgen 
幽玄とは、対象そのものにあるのではなく、人に喚起される感情の中にある
“Yūgen is not in the things themselves but in the feeling they evoke.” 
-Daisetz T. Suzuki, Zen scholar and writer
