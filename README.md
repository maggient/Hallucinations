# Project: Hallucinations
Welcome to Maggie Nguyenâ€™s CRCP3360 project, inspired by design thinking and rooted in the aesthetics and design principles of Japan.

## Trigger Warning: 
This project contains flashing lights and rapidly changing colors. Viewer discretion is advised. 

## About this project: 
Made with TouchDesigner, this project offers a visual representation of a hallucination from a first-person perspective. As cannabis is strictly illegal in Japan today, it has historically held significance in religious and ritual contexts. This work helps users imagine how the visual experience of being under the influence of cannabis might appear within sacred Japanese settings.
